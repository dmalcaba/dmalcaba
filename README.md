### Welcome!! ðŸ‘‹

I started out as a [Magic](https://www.magicsoftware.com/) Developer.  During that time I learned MSSQL and a bit of web programming.

I got fully immersed in .NET technologies when we migrated our Magic code to C# using [FireflyMigration](https://www.fireflymigration.com/).

My current project is a web UI framework built on .NET Core and EF.

- ðŸ”­ I have a passion for .NET technologies and love the way it is going. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blazor.
